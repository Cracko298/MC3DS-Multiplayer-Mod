# Minecraft-3DS-Multiplayer-Update
- [Star](https://github.com/Cracko298/Minecraft-3DS-Multiplayer-Update/stargazers), and (possibly) [Fork](https://github.com/Cracko298/Minecraft-3DS-Multiplayer-Update/fork) this repo to stay up-to-date on my Multiplayer Update for MC-3DS.
- This really isn't a "Mod" rather just reading and transferring packets to and from LAN Connections using a few Tools + Custom-Scripts/Launchers.
- It captures 3DS LAN Packets via CTRPF 3GX, and Transfers them over WiFi a "Client Software". will recieve the data, and Transfer it to another 3DS Console that has the same 3GX Plugin.
 
## How does it work?
- Clients will take that information and broadcast it over the network and then relays it back to the Server.

## Planned Features:
- Preventing Hacking/Cheating with a custom script on a AWS Server that scans for adnormal behaviors (now p2p support instead).
- Multiplayer over WiFi (Mostly finished although needs alot of ironing around the edges).

## Requirements:
- Hacked/Modfied/Homebrewed [New Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nintendo_3DS) (Any "New" Reversion) Console with [Luma3DS CFW](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) 11.0+.
- Opened 3DS Debug Port.
- PC with Client Software.
- Internet Connection.
- Custom Python Script to Communicate with the AWS Server.
- Other players ;)

## Download(s):
- **Client-Side [Download]() (If you want to connect to other Players' Servers).**
- **Server-Side [Download]() (If you would like to Host the server from your own console).**

**Notice: This is NOT a download (dummy links for now).**

## Notes:
- **May delay clients/servers into one.**
