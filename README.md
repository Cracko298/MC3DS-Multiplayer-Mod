# Minecraft-3DS-Multiplayer-Update
- [Star](https://github.com/Cracko298/Minecraft-3DS-Multiplayer-Update/stargazers), and (possibly) [Fork](https://github.com/Cracko298/Minecraft-3DS-Multiplayer-Update/fork) this repo to stay up-to-date on my Multiplayer Update for MC-3DS.

## Planned Features:
- Preventing Hacking/Cheating with a custom script on a AWS Server that scans for adnormal behaviors.
- Multiplayer over WiFi (Mostly finished although needs alot of ironing around the edges).

## Requirements:
- Opened 3DS Debug Port.
- PC with Wireshark.
- Internet Connection.
- Custom Python Script to Communicate with the AWS Server.
- Other players ;)

## Download(s):
- **Client-Side [Download]() (If you want to connect to other Players' Servers).
- **Server-Side [Download]() (If you would like to Host the server from your own console).** ***Limits extend to Minecraft-3DS Itself.***

**Notice: This is NOT a download (dummy links for now).**
